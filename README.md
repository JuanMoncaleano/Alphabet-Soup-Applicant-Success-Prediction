## Deep Learning Project Overview

Neural Network Modeling

## Background and Objective

Alphabet Soup, a charitable organization, seeks a solution for efficiently selecting applicants who are likely to succeed in their business endeavors once funded. Using machine learning and neural network techniques, the goal is to build a binary classifier that can effectively predict the success rate of these applicants.

The project utilizes a dataset shared by Alphabet Soup's business team, comprising meta-information about more than 34,000 previously funded organizations.

## Modules

scikit-learn
pandas
TensorFlow
Keras Tuner
Note: The project notebooks were developed and run on Google Colab.

Caution: Running Keras Tuner for optimization takes around 30 minutes on Google Colab.

## Project Insights

The computational notebooks for this project, developed on Google Colab, contain all the necessary steps for data preprocessing, partitioning, normalization, and neural network model training. These can be found in the AlphabetSoup_Initial_Analysis and AlphabetSoup_Optimization notebooks.

In the Model_Storage folder of this repository, the trained neural network models are saved for future use.

For a comprehensive explanation of the analytics and methodology, refer to the AnalysisReport.md file in the repository.
